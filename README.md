# README

This is the Prolog Program viewer. Prolog is a swedish larp convention. It's
homepage is over at [lajvkonvent.se](https://www.lajvkonvent.se/).

## Parts

- It is built in Javascript using [Mithril 2.0](https://mithril.js.org/).
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is the bundler for this project.

## How to develop

`src/main.js` is a good place to start, then run `npm run watch` to get a
server that automatically packs and reloads the code. You need access to the
backend to do something useful with the code, contact me to get access.
